##### Chatbot interface for user interaction
- Chating with an AI Analyst & Career Coach. A series of AI agents are used to provide the user with the information they need.
  - **Text to database queries**: Based on user's request AI automated queries are made to the database for relevant information using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) method.
  - **Analysis of Context**: An AI agent combines the database data and the user's question, to provide a comprehensive analysis to the user.
  - **Automated Graphs**: When possible another agents creates a graph related to the user's request.

For a high level overview of the tech behind the scenes, the power of _GenAI_ and _LLMs_ seem the way to go. However the real magic happens in the :blue[Knowledge Graph Database].

Below is a visual representation on how powerful the Knowledge Graph Database can be, by creating the appropriate nodes and relationships, of only 300 Jobs and 3.900 Total Nodes related to each other.
